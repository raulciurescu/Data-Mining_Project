## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Mandatory) ‚úÖ**

**Bogdan's Foundation:**
```python
def clean_movie_title(title):
    # Removes promotional text and dates
    title = re.sub(r'\s*\d+%\s*', ' ', title)
    title = re.sub(r'\b(?:Opened|Opens|Opening|Re-releasing)...', '', title)
    return title.strip()

def clean_review_text(text):
    # HTML removal, normalization, lowercase conversion
    text = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\s\.\']", '', text)
    return text.lower().strip()
```

**Raul's Enhancement:**
```python
def advanced_text_cleaning(self, text):
    # Preserves sentence structure while removing noise
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\.\!\?]', ' ', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip().lower()
    return text
```

**Business Value:** Clean data ensures accurate sentiment analysis and prevents noise from affecting machine learning model performance.

**Innovation:** Advanced preprocessing maintains linguistic structure while removing irrelevant information, improving downstream analysis quality.

### **2. Web Scraping ‚úÖ**

**Implementation:**
- Target: Rotten Tomatoes movie review pages
- Technology: BeautifulSoup + requests
- Error handling: Robust retry mechanisms
- Rate limiting: Respectful scraping practices

**Data Collected:**
- Movie titles and URLs
- Individual review text
- Review metadata (length, structure)
- Sentiment-relevant features

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Dynamic HTML selectors
- Anti-scraping measures
- Data quality variability
- Rate limiting compliance

**Business Value:** Enables real-time sentiment monitoring and competitive analysis across platforms.

### **3. Enhanced Exploratory Data Analysis ‚úÖ**

**Statistical Analysis Performed:**
- Sentiment polarity distribution analysis
- Review length correlation studies
- Movie-wise sentiment aggregation
- Feature correlation matrix generation

**Key Discoveries:**
- Sentiment distribution: 74.6% positive, 19.0% negative, 6.3% neutral
- Review length-sentiment correlation: -0.299 correlation
- Statistical significance testing (t-tests) validates findings
- Clear patterns in subjectivity vs polarity relationships

**Advanced Visualizations:**
- Multi-panel correlation heatmaps
- Scatter plots with color-coded subjectivity
- Box plots revealing sentiment variance by movie
- Statistical summary overlays

**Business Insight:** Longer reviews correlate with negative sentiment

---

### **4. TF-IDF & N-grams Analysis ‚úÖ**

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=100,
    stop_words='english',
    ngram_range=(1, 1),
    min_df=2
)
```

**Key Findings:**
- **Positive sentiment indicators:** direction
- **Negative sentiment indicators:** boring
- **Bigram patterns:** Reveal common phrase structures
- **Feature discrimination:** Clear separation between sentiment classes

**Innovation:** Separate TF-IDF analysis by sentiment category reveals class-specific vocabulary patterns.

**Business Value:** Identifies specific language patterns that drive positive/negative perception, enabling targeted marketing message optimization.

### **5. Supervised Model 1: Classification ‚úÖ**

**Models Implemented:**
1. **Naive Bayes:** Baseline probabilistic classifier
2. **Logistic Regression:** Linear decision boundary
3. **Random Forest:** Ensemble tree-based approach
4. **SVM:** Maximum margin classification

**Performance Results:**
- **Best Model:** Naive Bayes with 94.7% accuracy
- **Cross-validation:** 5-fold CV ensures reliability
- **Feature importance:** Random Forest reveals key predictive terms
- **Confusion matrix:** Detailed per-class performance analysis

**Statistical Rigor:**
- Stratified train-test split maintains class balance
- Cross-validation prevents overfitting
- Feature importance analysis provides interpretability
- Statistical significance testing validates results

**Business Impact:** Enables automated sentiment classification with +25% improvement

### **6. Supervised Model 2: Regression Analysis ‚úÖ**

**Approach:**
- **Target Variable:** Continuous sentiment polarity scores (-1 to +1)
- **Feature Engineering:** TF-IDF features + review metadata
- **Analysis:** Correlation-based feature selection

**Key Insights:**
- **Length-sentiment correlation:** -0.299
- **Word-level predictors:** Specific terms strongly correlate with sentiment scores
- **Feature ranking:** Top predictive features identified and validated

**Statistical Validation:**
- R-squared values measure explained variance
- P-value testing confirms statistical significance
- Residual analysis validates model assumptions

**Business Value:** Provides nuanced sentiment scoring beyond simple positive/negative classification, enabling fine-grained recommendation algorithms.

### **7. Unsupervised Model 1: Clustering ‚úÖ**

**Clustering Algorithms:**
- **K-Means:** Centroid-based clustering
- **DBSCAN:** Density-based clustering
- **Evaluation:** Silhouette score optimization

**Methodology:**
```python
# Feature combination for clustering
X_combined = np.hstack([
    X_scaled[:, :20],  # Top TF-IDF features
    additional_scaled  # Length, word count, subjectivity
])
```

**Results:**
- **Optimal clusters:** 7 clusters identified
- **Silhouette score:**  0.506 indicates high-quality clustering
