## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Mandatory) ‚úÖ**

**Bogdan's Foundation:**
```python
def clean_movie_title(title):
    # Removes promotional text and dates
    title = re.sub(r'\s*\d+%\s*', ' ', title)
    title = re.sub(r'\b(?:Opened|Opens|Opening|Re-releasing)...', '', title)
    return title.strip()

def clean_review_text(text):
    # HTML removal, normalization, lowercase conversion
    text = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\s\.\']", '', text)
    return text.lower().strip()
```

**Raul's Enhancement:**
```python
def advanced_text_cleaning(self, text):
    # Preserves sentence structure while removing noise
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\.\!\?]', ' ', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip().lower()
    return text
```
